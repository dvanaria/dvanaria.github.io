							<h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
							<p>I've been programming since a very young age (10 years old!) and have 
								development experience both as a hobbyist programmer and working 
								professionally. After obtaining my computer science undergraduate degree, the 
								majority of my professional experience has centered around quality assurance
								and automation testing, though the pull for me has always been toward development. 
								I've worked for many years as a private tutor to teach kids about computer programming,
								hopefully to instill that same joy and immediate appeal I had toward the subject at 
								a young age.

									<h3>Java</h3>
									<p>This was my university's language of choice during my years at SUNY Stony Brook. 
									   It's the langugae I cut my teeth on in terms of learning Object Oriented Programming
									   concepts and developing interactive GUI-based applications.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>JavaScript</h3>
									<p>It's a powerful language and it's absolutely indispensable
										 in today's technology landscape. It's shortcomings (in my opinion), 
										 mostly have to do with the number of different ways to accomplish the 
										same thing. Plus I've never fully accepted the benefit of function arrow
										syntax!</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>C</h3>
									<p>The C programming language has always been a favorite of mine, mostly
										because of the performance benefits of it's low-level implementation.
										I've been interested in game develpment from an early age, and this 
										language naturally applies. The SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library
										has also been a favorite of mine, written and designed with C in mind.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python is my language of choice. I love how much you can accomplish
										with such a small amount of python code. No other language comes close.
										It's also my favorite language to tutor with, because it forces kids
										to adopt a clean and structured coding style (due to the way python 
										enforces the use of spaces as a way to delinate code blocks, instead
										of the more common use of curly braces).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Azure DevOps</h3>
									<p>I have experience using this to manage Aglie team workloads, from hosting a Story Board to 
										running Pipelines to creating Test Suites/Scenarios/Cases.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Agile</h3>
									<p>A lot of experience working as a member of an Agile team. Daily
										work consisted of Scrum meetings, meetings with subject matter experts,
										working with Story Cards on a Story Board, writing Test Cases, helping
										create User Stories and Bug work items, helping to move those Story Cards
										over the finish line (the "done" column!).
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>BDD (Behavior Driven Development)</h3>
									<p>Experience working with key stakeholders (business analysts, qa/testers, developers)
										to work out features from the application's behavior as a starting point.
										Cucumber was used to write Feature files as a plain-english way to facilitate
										communication between these key stakeholders.
										</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Automation Testing</h3>
									<p>With Gherkin feature files as a starting point, I have experience implementing
										the automated tests (written in C#) using Selenium WebDriver.
										</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>SQL</h3>
									<p>Extensive experience writing reports (SQL scripts) for various stakeholders (sales, accounting). 
										Main experience is with MySQL, with some experience with Microsoft SQL Server.
