What is an .MDE file?
=====================

MDE files are mode & style files which can be called from the MMBASIC of Micromite Companion.

MDE files are required for compability with the expanded capabilities of the Micromite Companion.



How does an .MDE file differ from a MODEX.BIN file?
===================================================

Actually, they are exactly the same.  The change is only the name and how it is called.

You may assign any mode you want to function keys CTRL-F2 - CTRL-F8.

Pressing these keys will load mode{x}.bin.

.MDE files are executed with the I2C write command shown below from inside your code.

You may also launch a mode(x).mde file using the BRUN command from the mode 1 console.




Code Example:
=============

An example of the I2C MDE call looks like this:  I2C write &h42,0,3,1,2,4

The last digit "4" commands Micromite Companion to launch mode4.mde.  2-255 are accepted.

You may have up to 254 different .mde files on your SD card.  2-254.

MDE files are considered "hidden" files and are not displayed with Micromite Companion's DIR command.

An official list of .MDE modes are listed below:
