SDLoader Instructions
---------------------

1) Rename the .eeprom file that you wish to install to the firmware as loader.pgm.

2) Copy both sdloader.bin and loader.pgm to the SD card.

3) Using the BRUN command, execute sdloader.bin.

    From COLORBASIC, you can use BRUN "sdloader.bin" to execute the update.

    From uMitecompanion, you can use CTRL-B and sdloader.bin to execute the update.


WARNING: This will overwrite the existing firmware.  

If you overwrite with software that contains not BRUN ability, you will be unable to rewrite the firmware without a Propplug.
