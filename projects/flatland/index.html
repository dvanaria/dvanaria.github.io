            These aliens, known as the Thargoids, are showing no sign of

Frequently Asked Questions:

<br><br>



<br>

    Q. Why are some stars on the Galactic Map circled in green?

<br><br>

    A. Those star systems have been taken over by a Thargoid invasion fleet.

       The galaxy you live in (small as it is, with only 256 stars) is under

       attack by an alien race known as the Thargoids. Fighters from worlds

       all over have banded together, along with the Galactic Cooperative of 

       Worlds (GalCop) military force, to liberate systems from Thargoid 

       occupancy, one star system at a time. And you can help join the fight!

<br><br>

<br><br>

    Q. What are Fuel Scoops used for?

<br><br>

    A. Several things. Once installed on your ship, you can fly close to a 

       star and "skim" fuel from it, saving you lots of money at the fuel

       pump. Also, you can pick up items that may be floating through space,

       such as a cargo container from that pirate ship you just blew up, 

       or an asteroid shard you just created by blasting an asteroid with

       your mining laser.

<br><br>

<br><br>

    Q. These keyboard controls are terrible. How can I remap them?

<br><br>

    A. You can't in this version of the game. Unless you are a Python coder, 

       then you can. I would like to add this feature in a later version of 

       the game, but I have a four year old I take care of at home, so that's 

       not likely to happen any time soon. If you're able to add that feature

       (or any other features or bug fixes) please share with the rest of

       us!



<br><br>

<br><br>

    Q. What good is the escape pod? Seems dangerous...

<br><br>

    A. It's a great way to clear your legal record. If you've fallen down 

       the rabbit hole of a criminal life, you'll find yourself unable to 

       visit "civilized" systems anymore without being constantly harassed

       by bounty hunters and police. Abandon your ship and float to

       a nearby space station, and your ship will be re-instated (minus 

       cargo items), but your legal status will be cleared. (Useful tip:

       there's another way to clear your legal status - it involves killing

       a lot of Thargoids...)

<br><br>

<br><br>

    Q. I'm not clear about what actions change my legal status...

<br><br>

    A. There are lots of different ways you can tarnish your record. Destroying

       any civilians (Traders, Bounty Hunters) will certainly get you a 

       citation. So much as fire at the police or a space station, and you 

       will be cited. Buying or selling illegal items (slaves, narcotics, or

       firearms) in a civilized system (any type of government other than 

       Anarchy or Feudal) will also ping you. You are allowed 

       3 "strikes", and after that, you are considered a FUGITIVE.

<br><br>

<br><br>

    Q. You made the game too easy. I can go from a new game to a fully loaded

       ship with lots of spare cash in like, 45 minutes. Why did you make

       it like this?

<br><br>

    A. I made the game I wanted to play. I enjoyed so many gameplay elements

       of the original Elite (by David Braben and Ian Bell), but I no longer

       have the patience or free time needed to play it, even on an emulator

       that can speed things up a bit. I also

       tried to add a balance to the game which made many gameplay elements

       more accessible. Mining, for example, is a valid alternative

       to trading or bounty hunting as a means to earn enough money to deck

       out your ship and join the war against the Thargoids. In short, I love

       the classic game but wanted to make a version I could have fun with

       in short bursts of time (say, 15 minutes or so).
